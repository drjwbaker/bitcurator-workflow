# Processing Workflow for Digital Media

This repo contains a workflow - and associated materials - for processing archival digital media using [BitCurator](http://wiki.bitcurator.net/index.php?title=Main_Page). It captures work between the [Sussex Humanities Lab](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/shl/) and [University of Sussex Special Collections](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/library/specialcollections) undertaken in 2016 and is presented in a reworked form appropriate for general use (rather than containing all our particularly local stuff!).
